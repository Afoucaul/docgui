# docgui

## What is this?

This module turns your docopt command-line scripts into GUIs.
It's very straightforward to use: just replace your `__main__` section with `guify()`.
That's it.

## What does it look like?
This is made with Tkinter, so you'll have its look and feel.
To this day, I have made no work on appearance, so it's plain basic.
